# Incremental Analysis Maven Plugin

This Maven Plugin helps developers to run static analysis only for updated codes.
Designed to use in incremental build, like pre-merge build and local build.

## How to use

### Introduce incremental-analysis plugin to your Maven project

Add the following `<plugin>` element into your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>com.worksap.tools</groupId>
  <artifactId>incremental-analysis-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
</plugin>
```

Make sure it runs before the [spotbugs-maven-plugin](https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/).

### Run incremental analysis in local

By default, this plugin runs to detect changes between your `HEAD` and `refs/heads/master`.
This fits [the GitHub Flow](https://githubflow.github.io/) and [the GitLab Flow](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/workflow/gitlab_flow.html).

If you want to full analysis in local, use `<skip>` configuration then Maven run full analysis by default.
You may overwrite this configuration by profile activated in the CI build.

```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>com.worksap.tools</groupId>
  <artifactId>incremental-analysis-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
  <configuration>
    <skip>true</skip>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
```

## Known problems

* No support for checkstyle, PMD and other tools.
* No support for other programming languages.
* This version is not marked as thread safe. Current implementation expects that analysis maven plugin runs just after this plugin. For instance, following scenario with two threads may break the build:
    1. Module A runs incremental-analysis-maven-plugin, and set `spotbugs.skip` as `true`
    2. Module B runs incremental-analysis-maven-plugin, and set `spotbugs.skip` as `false`
    3. Module A runs spotbugs-maven-plugin. We expect that Maven skips execution (see 1.) but now `spotbugs.skip` is `false` so it will not be skipped.
* This plugin does not ensure that the target branch has no potential bugs. It is possible to merge buggy code in several cases:
    1. You added `@CheckForNull` to a method defined in interface. Then SpotBugs may find potential bug in its implementation, but it cannot be found by incremental analysis because it scans updated classes only.
    2. You added `@CheckForNull` to a method. Then SpotBugs may find potential bug in its caller, but it cannot be found by incremental analysis because it scans updated classes only.
